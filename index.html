            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>IHI, MY NAME IS
                lindsay!
                And Pinch of Yum is my little corner of the internet!

                I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Pinch of Yum. What started as a casual hobby over 10 years ago
                in 2010 while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that
                reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has been featured on The
                Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more.

                I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My favorite things in life are a big
                plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.</p>
